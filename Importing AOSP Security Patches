Go to vendor/<your rom name>

git fetch https://github.com/aoleary/platform_vendor_aos.githttps://github.com/aoleary/platform_vendor_aos.git
git cherry-pick -x 3ff6e7ba5e600806e5ba11bf8b9e55417f5aadaa


Go to manifest of your ROM. For Atomic-OS, its - https://github.com/Atomic-OS/platform_manifest
And find the xml. For Atomic-OS it is aos.xml


Then cd to vendor/<your rom name>/scripts

Modify the script (merge-aosp.sh) to the xml related to your ROM
Modify the lines:
https://github.com/aoleary/platform_vendor_aos/blob/oreo/scripts/merge-aosp.sh#L72-L73
      if grep -q "$i" $WORKING_DIR/manifest/o8x_default.xml; then # If we have it in our manifest and
        if grep "$i" $WORKING_DIR/manifest/o8x_default.xml | grep -q "remote="; then # If we track our own copy of it

from:
o8x_default.xml
to your xml name.

In my case, aos.xml
      if grep -q "$i" $WORKING_DIR/manifest/aos.xml; then # If we have it in our manifest and
        if grep "$i" $WORKING_DIR/manifest/aos.xml | grep -q "remote="; then # If we track our own copy of it

Then cd back to the root of your ROM build folder
In my case:
cd ~/Atomic

NOTE: Security patches are not cumulative, so you need to import the next in the sequence after what has been imported into your system.
Go to the commit history of the build repo for your ROM.
e.g. https://github.com/Atomic-OS/platform_build/commits/oreo
Look for a commit that begins with:
Merge tag 'android-8.1.0_rXX


You need to import the next tag in the sequence. Go here to find the list of tags:
https://android.googlesource.com/platform/manifest/+refs
I chose "android-8.1.0_r42", as this was the next highest numbered tag for "my" ROM.

Your tag name to run the script with, will be: 8.1.0_r42


Then run the script from the root of your ROM build folder (NOT from vendor/<your rom name>/scripts )
. vendor/aos/scripts/merge-aosp.sh 8.1.0_r43 2>&1 | tee merge.log

Wait for the script to finish, and you should see the following repos marked with conflicts:
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.

These repos have merge errors: 

frameworks/av
frameworks/base
manifest
ota
packages/apps/Messaging
packages/apps/MusicFX
packages/apps/Settings
build/make

We need to cd to each one and then run "git status" to know which files caused the conflicts..

Lets take an easy one
root@aoleary:~/atomic# cd build/make
root@aoleary:~/atomic/build/make# git status
Not currently on any branch.
You have unmerged paths.
  (fix conflicts and run "git commit")
  (use "git merge --abort" to abort the merge)

Unmerged paths:
  (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)

        both modified:   core/build_id.mk
        both modified:   core/version_defaults.mk

root@aoleary:~/atomic/build/make# nano core/version_defaults.mk

First part (after HEAD) is what is removed.
Second part is what is to be added..
<<<<<<< HEAD
      PLATFORM_SECURITY_PATCH := 2018-07-05
=======
      PLATFORM_SECURITY_PATCH := 2018-08-05
>>>>>>> 0ddcd02b6db9aa6af344cad0f4815b212fe0163a

root@aoleary:~/atomic/build/make# add core/version_defaults.mk
root@aoleary:~/atomic/build/make# nano core/build_id.mk
root@aoleary:~/atomic/build/make# add core/build_id.mk
root@aoleary:~/atomic/build/make# cd ~/atomic

Build the ROM. Correct any errors and when it builds successfully, test the build.

Now we go to the committing actions..

First we start with the repos that had merge errors, as we already have that list
In my case, these repos were highlighted when I ran the script.
frameworks/av
frameworks/base
manifest
ota
packages/apps/Messaging
packages/apps/MusicFX
packages/apps/Settings
build/make

We need to cd to each directory and do the following:
Do "git status" to see what files are affected.
Then do "git add ." to add all changes to the future commit.
Add the files to the commit: git commit -m "Merge tag 'android-8.1.0_r42' into 8.1" => Change this as per your tag that you merged with the script
Fork the repo to your github, if not already done
Add the branch info locally: git remote add  <branch name> <git repo to be added> => to be done only once
Push to the remote github: git push -u <branch name> HEAD:<branch name>

Next, we need to analyse the merge.log to see what repos were updated automatically, without conflicts.

Copy the merge.log to your desktop where you can modify it with Notepad++.

Open the merge.log in Notepad++, and click on the menu "Search" then, "Mark..."
Choose the option "Bookmark line"
In the "Find what" field enter: Checking out files
Choose "Mark All"
You should have all the lines with "Checking out files" highlighted
Next, in the "Find what" field enter: new tag
Choose "Mark All"
You should have all the lines with " * [new tag]" highlighted
Click Close

Click on the menu "Search" then, "Bookmark", then "Remove Bookmarked lines"

This will strip out most of the 'clutter', so we can see more easily.

Click on the menu "Search" then, "Find" and search for "file changed"
This will show us the repos that have been updated without merge errors.
e.g.
From https://android.googlesource.com/platform//frameworks/opt/telephony
 * tag                   android-8.1.0_r42           -> FETCH_HEAD
Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.
 .../android/internal/telephony/mocks/ConnectivityServiceMock.java    | 5 +++++
 1 file changed, 5 insertions(+)
 
The repo it relates to, is the repo just above it, in this case "frameworks/opt/telephony"
So we need to cd to that directory and push the changes to our forked repo.
Note: if you do a "git status" it will not show anthing changed, but if you do a push, you will see that changes will be pushed:
cd ~/atomic/frameworks/opt/telephony

Do the same for all other repos that have "file changed".

DONE!
